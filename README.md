This Project Contains Source Code for some Simple Swing GUI applications. You can take help if you are facing any issue. Do not copy the whole code as it will not help you.

## Program 1
Using Swing, write a program to display a string in frame window with pink colour as background. 

## Program 2
Using Swing, write a program to create two buttons named “Red” and “Blue”. When a button is pressed the background color should be set to the color named by the button’s label.
